## Javascript and classes

- Javascript is prototype-based language.

## OOP

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm(paeadime) that uses "objects"

## Object

- collection of properties and method.
- Ex : toLowercase, Promice, Data and etc.

## why use OOP

1. Reusability - if we have common functionality in multiple objects then instead of writing the same
   code again and again we can create one object which contains this functionlity and other objects can
   use it by calling this object. This saves time and effort.
2. Maintainability - If there are 50 forms in an application and all these
   forms need to display date in dd/mm/yyyy format then instead of changing code for each form
   we just change the behavior of Date object.
3. Extensibility - We can add new features to existing objects without modifying them.
4. Modularity - It helps us to group related functionalities together under single entity i.e., A class represents a module or unit of software.
5. Modularity - It helps us to group related functionalities together under single entity called class
   and make our program more modular.

## Part of OOP

Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
